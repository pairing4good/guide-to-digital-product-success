## **Startup Guidelines**

### **1. Maintain Ownership & Understanding**

*Core message: Control your digital destiny*

- **Take direct control**: Create all accounts in your name, not your developer’s
- **Use Infrastructure as Code**: Start with platforms like AWS Amplify that handle it automatically
- **Plan for compliance early**: Build SOC 2 basics now (encryption, audit logs, secure auth)

### **2. Understand Customers Quickly**

*Core message: Stay connected to real problems*

- **Create visual story maps**: Connect every piece of work to actual customer problems
- **Set up simple dashboards**: Track metrics that inform decisions, not vanity metrics
- **Demo weekly**: 30-minute Friday demos of live features only—builds urgency and prevents waste

### **3. Deploy Frequently While Minimizing Risk**

*Core message: Move fast without breaking things*

- **Use modern development practices**: Feature branches, hourly commits, pull request reviews, automated tests
- **Implement feature flags**: Release to 5% of users first, expand gradually (tools like Statsig)
- **Focus on key metrics**: Track what matters—business health, customer engagement, engineering performance

### **4. Choose Tools That Grow With Your Business**

*Core message: Build for scale from day one*

- **Go serverless**: Use frameworks like AWS Amplify—pay nothing when idle, scales automatically
- **Skip native apps initially**: Build responsive web apps first, add native only when customers demand it
- **Integrate AI tools**: GitHub Copilot for coding acceleration, automated reviews, AI agents for repetitive tasks
- **Stick to 4 core technologies**: AWS Amplify, Statsig, GitHub, GitHub Copilot

## **Outcome:**

These guidelines position startups to be able to scale development quickly. The goal is eliminating the choice between speed and quality by building systems that enable both.
